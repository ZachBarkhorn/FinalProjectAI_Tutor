    "response": "## \ud83d\udc0d Beginner Python Exercise  \n\n### Problem Description  \nWrite a program that reads **three integers** from the user and prints their **average** rounded to two decimal places.  \n\nThe program should:  \n\n1. Prompt the user (or just read) for three separate integer values.  \n2. Compute the arithmetic mean of the three numbers.  \n3. Output the result in the format `Average: X.XX` where `X.XX` is the average rounded to two decimal points.  \n\n---\n\n### Input  \nThe input consists of **three lines**, each containing a single integer.  \n\n```\na\nb\nc\n```\n\n* `a`, `b`, `c` can be any integer (positive, negative, or zero).\n\n---\n\n### Output  \nPrint a single line exactly as shown below:\n\n```\nAverage: X.XX\n```\n\n* `X.XX` is the average of the three numbers, rounded to **two** decimal places.\n\n---\n\n### Example  \n\n**Sample Input**\n\n```\n10\n20\n30\n```\n\n**Sample Output**\n\n```\nAverage: 20.00\n```\n\n**Explanation**  \nThe sum is `10 + 20 + 30 = 60`.  \nThe average is `60 / 3 = 20`.  \nFormatted to two decimal places it becomes `20.00`.\n\n---\n\n### Constraints (for reference)  \n\n- The three numbers fit in the normal Python `int` range.  \n- No special error handling is required; you can assume the input is always valid integers.\n\n---\n\n### Suggested Steps for Beginners  \n\n1. **Read the three numbers** using `input()`. Convert each to `int`.  \n2. **Calculate the sum** and then divide by `3`.  \n3. Use Python\u2019s string formatting to round to two decimal places, e.g., `\"{:.2f}\".format(value)` or an f\u2011string.  \n4. **Print** the result with the required text.\n\n---\n\n### Sample Solution (for you to test)\n\n```python\n# Step 1: read three integers\na = int(input())\nb = int(input())\nc = int(input())\n\n# Step 2: calculate the average\naverage = (a + b + c) / 3\n\n# Step 3: format to two decimal places and print\nprint(f\"Average: {average:.2f}\")\n```\n\nGive it a try! \ud83d\ude80  \nIf you get stuck, remember:\n* `int()` converts a string to an integer.\n* `:.2f` tells Python to display a floating\u2011point number with exactly two digits after the decimal point.  \n\nHappy coding! \ud83c\udf89",
