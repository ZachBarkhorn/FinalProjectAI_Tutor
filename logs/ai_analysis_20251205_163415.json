    "response": "**Hey there!** \ud83d\udc0d  \nLet\u2019s take a look at the snippet you shared and see why Python is complaining.\n\n---\n\n## The original code\n\n```python\nfor i in range(3)\n    print(i)\n```\n\n---\n\n## What\u2019s wrong?  \n\n| # | Issue | Why it causes an error | Simple explanation |\n|---|-------|------------------------|--------------------|\n| 1 | **Missing colon (`:`) after `range(3)`** | In Python a `for` loop header must end with a colon to tell the interpreter \u201cthe next indented block belongs to this loop\u201d. | Think of the colon as the \u201cstart of the block\u201d marker. |\n| 2 | **Indentation of `print(i)`** (in the posted code it's aligned with the `for` line) | After the colon, the body of the loop must be indented (commonly 4 spaces). Without indentation Python sees the line as outside the loop and will raise an `IndentationError`. | Python uses whitespace to define blocks, unlike languages that use braces `{}`. |\n| 3 (optional) | **No newline after the colon** \u2013 not a syntax error, but it makes the code harder to read. | Adding a line break after the colon lets you clearly see the loop\u2019s body. | Good style! |\n\n---\n\n## Fixed version\n\n```python\n# A simple loop that prints 0, 1, and 2\nfor i in range(3):\n    print(i)\n```\n\n**What changed?**\n\n1. **Added the colon** after `range(3)`.\n2. **Indented** the `print(i)` line by 4 spaces (or one tab) to show it belongs to the loop.\n3. Added a short comment and a blank line for readability\u2014optional but helpful.\n\n---\n\n## Quick test\n\nRun the corrected code in a Python shell or script and you\u2019ll see:\n\n```\n0\n1\n2\n```\n\nGreat job spotting the issue! Keep experimenting, and remember:\n\n- **Colon (`:`)** \u2192 marks the start of a block (loops, functions, conditionals).  \n- **Indentation** \u2192 tells Python which lines are inside that block.\n\nHappy coding! \ud83d\ude80 If you have any more questions or want to try a slightly more complex loop, just let me know.",
