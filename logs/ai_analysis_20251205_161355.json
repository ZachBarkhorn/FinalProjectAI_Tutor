    "response": "## \u2705 What does \u201center a few sentences\u201d usually mean in Python?\n\nWhen a program asks you to **\u201center a few sentences\u201d** it wants the user to type more than one line of text.  \nIn Python we capture that text with the **`input()`** function (or with a little loop if we need several lines).\n\nBelow you\u2019ll see a **step\u2011by\u2011step** walk\u2011through of three common ways to let a user type a few sentences and then use those sentences in your program.\n\n---\n\n## 1\ufe0f\u20e3 One\u2011liner: Let the user type everything in a single `input()` call  \n\nIf you don\u2019t need separate lines, you can simply ask the user to type all sentences in one line, separating them with punctuation (e.g., a period).\n\n```python\n# Ask the user to type a few sentences, all on one line\ntext = input(\"Enter a few sentences (separated by periods): \")\n\nprint(\"\\nYou typed:\")\nprint(text)\n```\n\n**What happens**\n\n1. The program prints the prompt inside `input()`.\n2. The user types something like  \n   `I love Python. It makes me happy.`  \n   (then presses **Enter**).\n3. The whole line is stored in the variable `text`.\n4. We print it back out.\n\n*Use this when the amount of text is small and you don\u2019t need each sentence on its own line.*\n\n---\n\n## 2\ufe0f\u20e3 Multi\u2011line input with a **loop**  \n\nOften we want each sentence on its own line. The easiest way is to keep calling `input()` until the user signals \u201cI\u2019m done\u201d. A common convention is to let the user type an empty line (`\"\"`) to stop.\n\n```python\nsentences = []                     # a list that will hold each sentence\n\nprint(\"Enter a few sentences (press Enter on a blank line to finish):\")\n\nwhile True:\n    line = input(\"> \")            # show a little prompt for each line\n    if line == \"\":                # user just hit Enter \u2192 stop reading\n        break\n    sentences.append(line)        # store the line\n\nprint(\"\\nYou entered the following sentences:\")\nfor i, s in enumerate(sentences, start=1):\n    print(f\"{i}. {s}\")\n```\n\n**Step\u2011by\u2011step explanation**\n\n| Step | What the code does | Why it matters |\n|------|--------------------|----------------|\n| `sentences = []` | Creates an empty list to collect the sentences. | Lists are perfect for storing an arbitrary number of items. |\n| `while True:` | Starts an infinite loop that will keep asking for input. | We\u2019ll break out of it when the user signals \u201cdone\u201d. |\n| `line = input(\"> \")` | Shows a `>` prompt and reads one line of text. | `input()` always returns a **string**. |\n| `if line == \"\": break` | If the line is empty, stop the loop. | An empty line is our \u201cstop signal\u201d. |\n| `sentences.append(line)` | Adds the entered line to our list. | We now have all sentences stored in order. |\n| The final `for` loop | Prints each stored sentence with a number. | Gives the user a nice, numbered recap. |\n\n**Try it out**  \n\n```\nEnter a few sentences (press Enter on a blank line to finish):\n> I love programming.\n> Python is my favorite language.\n> It feels like magic!\n> \n```\n\nThe program will output:\n\n```\nYou entered the following sentences:\n1. I love programming.\n2. Python is my favorite language.\n3. It feels like magic!\n```\n\n---\n\n## 3\ufe0f\u20e3 Reading **all** remaining lines at once (`sys.stdin.read`)  \n\nIf you run a script from the command line and want to let the user paste a whole paragraph (including line breaks) and then hit **Ctrl\u2011D** (Linux/macOS) or **Ctrl\u2011Z** (Windows) to finish, you can read everything in one go:\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\nprint(\"Paste a few sentences (finish with Ctrl-D / Ctrl-Z):\")\ntext = sys.stdin.read()   # reads until EOF (end\u2011of\u2011file)\n\nprint(\"\\nYou wrote:\")\nprint(text)\n```\n\n**When to use this**\n\n- When you expect the user to paste a large block of text.\n- When you want to keep the original line breaks exactly as entered.\n\n**Note:** `sys.stdin.read()` returns a single string that may contain `\\n` characters (line breaks). You can split it into separate sentences later, e.g.:\n\n```python\nsentences = [s.strip() for s in text.split('\\n') if s.strip()]\n```\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udccc Common Mistakes & How to Fix Them  \n\n| Mistake | Why it happens | Fix |\n|--------|----------------|-----|\n| Forgetting to **press Enter** after typing the last line in the loop example. | The loop is still waiting for another line. | Press **Enter** on an empty line to break out. |\n| Using `int(input())` when you only need text. | `int()` tries to convert the input to a number and throws a `ValueError` if the user typed letters. | Remove the `int()` and keep the value as a string. |\n| Trying to use `input()` inside a Jupyter notebook cell and expecting it to read multiple lines automatically. | Jupyter\u2019s `input()` stops at the first **Enter** key. | Either use the loop method or paste the whole paragraph into a single `input()` call. |\n| Mixing `print()` and `input()` prompts without a newline, causing the prompt to appear on the same line as previous output. | `print()` by default adds a newline, but if you use `end=''` it won\u2019t. | Keep the default newline or add `\\n` manually for clarity. |\n\n---\n\n## \ud83c\udf89 Quick Practice Challenge  \n\nWrite a program that:\n\n1. Asks the user to enter a few sentences (use the loop method).  \n2. Counts how many **words** were entered in total.  \n3. Prints the total word count.\n\n**Solution Sketch**\n\n```python\nsentences = []\nprint(\"Enter sentences (blank line to stop):\")\nwhile True:\n    line = input(\"> \")\n    if not line:\n        break\n    sentences.append(line)\n\n# Join all sentences into one big string, then split on whitespace\nall_text = \" \".join(sentences)\nwords = all_text.split()\n\nprint(f\"\\nYou typed {len(words)} words.\")\n```\n\nRun it, type a few lines, and watch the count appear! \ud83c\udf89\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\ude4c Keep Going!\n\nYou\u2019ve learned three practical ways to let a user **enter a few sentences**:\n\n1. One\u2011line `input()`.  \n2. A loop that collects multiple lines until an empty line.  \n3. `sys.stdin.read()` for big pasted blocks.\n\nFeel free to experiment with each method, and don\u2019t hesitate to ask if anything feels unclear.
